# Flight-Delay-EDA-using-R
This analysis seeks to explore and visualise how these factors correlate with delays, particularly focusing on understanding the number of delayed flights, how weather impacts delays, and the distribution of delays across different times, days, and carriers.

**Goal**: To visualise the effect of various factors like scheduled time, carrier, destination, weather, and day of the week on flight delays, using a variety of plots.

**Description**: Flight delays are influenced by several factors such as scheduled times, weather conditions, and the carrier. This analysis seeks to explore and visualise how these factors correlate with delays, particularly focusing on understanding the number of delayed flights, how weather impacts delays, and the distribution of delays across different times, days, and carriers.

**Skills**: Lubridate library, Difftime, Aggregate, Missing values handling, Histogram plot, Barplot, Scatter plot, and Box plot.

**Results**: After thoroughly cleaning and preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and converting relevant variables, insightful visualisations were created to understand the relationships between flight delays and key factors such as scheduled time, carrier, weather, and origin/destination.
